I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.\n\nDon't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.\n\nI find your lack of faith disturbing. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?\n\nEscape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. I'm trying not to, kid. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?\n\nAlderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possiblyâ€¦\n\nI find your lack of faith disturbing. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? I find your lack of faith disturbing.",
